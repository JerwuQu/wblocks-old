Grunt work and bugfixes:
    Properly clean up on exit and errors
    Good config documentation on wiki
    Make mouse clicks more reliable - you currently need to click on actual text pixels for it to register (perhaps listen in DLL instead?)

Features:
    Scroll event
    Mod keys (ctrl, shift, alt) for interact events

Minor features:
    Config for manual bar colorkey
    Config for hiding terminal
    Function for creating a repeating timer

Unspecified:
    Allow single script to control multiple blocks. Unsure how lua API would look.

Tests:
    What happens with taskbars on multiple monitors?
