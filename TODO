Properly clean up on exit and errors
Make mouse clicks more reliable - you currently need to click on actual text pixels for it to register (perhaps listen in DLL instead?)
Calculate text width and resize wblocks (?) (probably not needed if width is set in config)
Allow single script to control multiple blocks. Unsure how lua API would look.
